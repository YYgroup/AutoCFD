description: "Do a RAS simulation of flow in a planar contraction channel using simpleFoam with inlet velocity of 3.876 m/s, and a Newtonian fluid with kinematic viscosity of 1e-6 m^2/s. Turbulence modeled with kOmegaSST. The omega is 40. Control settings include: endTime = 0.25, and writeInterval = 0.01."
