description: "Do a steady-state 2D airfoil simulation using simpleFoam with the Spalart-Allmaras turbulence model. Kinematic viscosity: `nu = 8.58e-6 m²/s`. Patch `walls` is the walls of the wings. Control settings include: endTime = 2000, deltaT = 1, and writeInterval = 50.\n
Initial boundary conditions:\n
nuTilda: internal field is 3.432e-5; inlet & outlet is 3.432e-5; walls is 0.\n
nut: internal field is 8.58e-6; inlet & outlet is 8.58e-6; walls is 0.\n
p: internal field is 0; inlet & outlet is 0. \n
U: internal field is (51.4325 -2.2456 0); inlet & outlet is (51.4325 -2.2456 0); walls is (0 0 0)"
