description: "Do a steady-state simulation of flow through a pipe using simpleFoam with an inlet velocity of 1 m/s, using Newtonian fluid with viscosity 0.01. Control settings include: endTime = 1000, writeControl = runTime, and writeInterval = 10.\n
Initial boundary conditions: \n
p: outlet: 0. \n
U: inlet: (1 0 0). top and bottom: (0 0 0)."
