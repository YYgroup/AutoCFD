description: "Do a RAS simulation of jet flow using simpleFoam with inlet velocity of (10 0 0) m/s, and a Newtonian fluid with kinematic viscosity of 1.5e-5 m^2/s. Turbulence modeled with kOmegaSST. Control settings include: endTime = 1000, and writeInterval = 50.\n
Initial boundary conditions: \n
k: inlet and atmosphere: 0.01 \n
nut: 0 \n
omega: inlet and atmosphere: 1 \n
U: The internalField is (1 0 0). inlet is (10 0 0). atmosphere: pressure InletOutlet velocity with value (0 0 0)."
