description: "Perform a steady ahmed single simulation using simpleFoam with the k-epsilon turbulence model, nu = 1.46e-05 m²/s. Control settings include: endTime = 200, deltaT = 1, and writeInterval = 25.\n
Initial boundary conditions:  \n
k: internalField is 0.24; inlet, outlet, bottom and ahmed is 0.24. top, front and back is symmetry.\n
epsilon: internalField is 345; inlet, outlet, bottom and ahmed is 345. top, front and back is symmetry.\n
nut: fixedValue 0. top, front and back is symmetry.\n
p: internalField is 0; outlet is 0. top, front and back is symmetry.\n
U: internalField is (40 0 0); inlet and bottom is (40 0 0); ahmed and outlet is (0 0 0). top, front and back is symmetry."
