description: "Do a laminar simulation of vortex shedding around a circular cylinder using pimpleFoam with inlet velocity of (1 0 0) m/s, Newtonian fluid model with nu = 0.01. Use laminar in turbulenceProperties. Control settings include: endTime = 250, writeControl = runTime, and writeInterval = 1. \n
Initial boundary conditions: \n
p: 'out': 0, 'in': zeroGradient \n
U: The internalField is (1 0 0). 'in': (1 0 0). 'out': zeroGradient. 'cylinder': (0 0 0)."
