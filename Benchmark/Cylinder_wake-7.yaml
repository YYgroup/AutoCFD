description: "Do a RAS simulation of vortex shedding around a cylinder using pimpleFoam with inlet velocity of 1 m/s. outlet's velocity is zero gradient. Use k-omega SST turbulence model. Fluid properties: Newtonian with viscosity nu = 0.0002. Control settings include: endTime = 250, writeControl = runTime, and writeInterval = 1. \n
Initial boundary conditions:\n
The omega of 'cylinder', 'in' and 'out' are 0.075. \n
The k of 'cylinder', 'in' and 'out' are 0.00015 \n
p: 'out': 0. \n
U: The internalField is (1 0 0). 'in': (1 0 0). 'out': zeroGradient. 'cylinder': (0 0 0)."
