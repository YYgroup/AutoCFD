description: "Do a RAS simulation of flow around a rectangular cylinder using pimpleFoam with inlet velocity 1 m/s. Turbulence modeled with kOmegaSST. Fluid properties include dynamic viscosity 2e-08 m^2/s. Control settings include: endTime = 100, and writeInterval = 0.5.\n
Initial boundary conditions: \n
k: inlet and cylinder: 0.00375 \n
omega: inlet and cylinder: 0.0612 \n
p: 101325.\n 
U: The internalField and inlet is (1 0 0). outlet and cylinder: (0 0 0)."
