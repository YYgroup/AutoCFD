description: "Perform a steady-state airfoil simulation using simpleFoam with the Spalart-Allmaras turbulence model. Kinematic viscosity: `nu = 2.44e-7 m²/s`. Control settings include: endTime = 1000, deltaT = 1, and writeInterval = 100.\n
Initial boundary conditions:  \n
nuTilda: internal field is 2e-06; farfield is 2e-06; wall_slat, wall_airfoil and wall_flap is 0.\n
nut: fixed value 0.\n
p: internal field is 0; farfield is 0. \n
U: internal field is (0.99 0.1412 0); farfield is (0.99 0.1412 0); wall_slat, wall_airfoil and wall_flap is (0 0 0)"
