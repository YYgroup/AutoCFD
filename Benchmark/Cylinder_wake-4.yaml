description: "Do a RAS simulation of vortex shedding around a cylinder using simpleFoam with inlet velocity of 1 m/s. Models and parameters include the kOmegaSST turbulence model. Fluid properties are Newtonian with a kinematic viscosity of 0.01. Control settings include: endTime = 5000, writeControl = runTime, and writeInterval = 50.\n
Initial boundary conditions: \n
omega: 0.075. \n
p: 'out': 0. \n
U: The internalField is (1 0 0). 'in': (1 0 0). 'out': zeroGradient. 'cylinder': (0 0 0)."
