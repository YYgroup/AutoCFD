description: "Do a steady-state simulation of vortex shedding around a cylinder using simpleFoam with inlet velocity of (1 0 0) m/s, laminar flow model, and kinematic viscosity nu = 0.05. The outlet velocity is zero gradient. Control settings include: endTime = 500, writeControl = runTime, and writeInterval = 10. \n
Initial boundary conditions:\n
p: 'out' is 0 . \n
U: The internalField is (1 0 0). 'in' is (1 0 0). 'out' is zeroGradient. 'cylinder' is (0 0 0)."
