description: "Do a RAS simulation of vortex shedding around a cylinder using pimpleFoam with inlet velocity = (1 0 0), the outlet velocity = (0 0 0), k-omega SST turbulence model, and Newtonian fluid properties (nu = 0.01 m^2/s). Control settings include: endTime = 300, writeControl = runTime, and writeInterval = 1.\n
Initial boundary conditions:\n
The k value of 'cylinder', 'out' and 'in' is 0.00015. \n
The omega value of 'cylinder', 'out' and 'in' is 0.0045. \n
p: 'out': 0.\n
U: The internalField and 'in' are  (1 0 0). The 'out' and 'cylinder' are (0 0 0)."
