description: "Do a RAS simulation of vortex shedding around a cylinder using pimpleFoam with inlet velocity of 1 m/s. outlet's velocity is zero gradient. Use k-omega SST turbulence model. Fluid properties: Newtonian with a kinematic viscosity of 0.00002 m^2/s. Control settings include: endTime = 300, writeControl = runTime, and writeInterval = 1.\n
Initial boundary conditions:\n
omega: 'cylinder' is 0.075. \n
k: 'cylinder', 'in', 'out' is 0.00015. \n
p: 'out': 0. \n
U: The internalField and 'in' is (1 0 0). 'out' is zeroGradient. 'cylinder'is (0 0 0)."
