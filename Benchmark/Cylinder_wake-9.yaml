description: "Do a RAS simulation of vortex shedding around a cylinder using simpleFoam with inlet velocity = (1 0 0) m/s. Outlet velocity is zero gradient. The cylinder surface uses wall functions for turbulence modeling. The kOmegaSST turbulence model. Fluid properties include kinematic viscosity nu = 0.00002. Control settings include: endTime = 400, writeControl = runTime, and writeInterval = 50. \n
Initial boundary conditions:\n
The omega of 'cylinder' is 0.0045. \n
p: 'out': 0. \n
U: The internalField is (1 0 0). 'in': (1 0 0). 'out': zeroGradient. 'cylinder': (0 0 0)."
